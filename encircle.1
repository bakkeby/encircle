.TH ENCIRCLE 1 encircle\-VERSION
.SH NAME
encircle \- a Xinerama X cursor monitor wrapper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B encircle
.RB [ \-hvfxys ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
encircle is a window manager agnostic tool that wraps your X cursor around the
edges of the screen and is specifically designed to work with asymmetric
multi-monitor Xinerama setups.
.P
In practice what this means is that the screen area is turned into a flat
torus in that when the cursor hits a screen edge then it will continue and
reappear on the opposite edge.

If snap is enabled and the cursor position is not within the target screen
then the cursor will snap to the nearest edge of that screen.

By default cursor snapping and wrapping is enabled on both horizontal and
vertical axes.

In the above example we have four transitions:
   1) snaps to the adjacent monitor (rather than hitting a hard wall)
   2) wraps the cursor from monitor A to monitor C which is the rightmost monitor
   3) snaps to the adjacent monitor (rather than hitting a hard wall)
   4) wraps around monitor B because there is no other monitor above or below

If the monitor arrangement is changed (e.g. using xrandr) then encircle will be
notified of that and update monitor positions and dimensions accordingly.
